eyediagram
==========

Fork from Warren Weckesser's repo: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/eyediagram

`eyediagram` is a python library for generating eye diagrams (also known as
[eye patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_pattern)).

This is prototype-quality software.  The documentation is thin, and the API may
change.

To build the package, cython and numpy must be installed.

To use the package, numpy and scipy must be installed.  Plots are generated with
either matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/) or bokeh (http://bokeh.pydata.org/),
so usually either one of those must be installed.  However, the core function
`eyediagram.core.grid_count` generates a numpy array that can be displayed or
saved as an image using any other plotting or image-handling software, so it
is not a strict requirement that `matplotlib` or `bokeh` be installed.  See
the script `pyqtgraph_demo.py` in the `demo` directory for an example that
uses `pyqtgraph` (http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) to display the eye diagram.  The
plot generated by that script is shown below.


Example - matplotlib
--------------------

This is `mpl_demo.py`.  It uses the `eyediagram` function from the
`eyediagram.mpl` module to plot an eye diagram using `matplotlib`.


    from eyediagram.demo_data import demo_data
    from eyediagram.mpl import eyediagram
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


    num_symbols = 5000
    samples_per_symbol = 24

    y = demo_data(num_symbols, samples_per_symbol)

    eyediagram(y, 2*samples_per_symbol, offset=16, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)

    plt.show()

Example - bokeh
---------------

This is `bok_demo.py`.  It uses the `eyediagram` function from the
`eyediagram.bok` module to plot an eye diagram using `bokeh`.

    from eyediagram.demo_data import demo_data
    from eyediagram.bok import eyediagram
    from matplotlib.cm import coolwarm
    from bokeh.plotting import show


    # Get some data for the demonstration.
    num_symbols = 5000
    samples_per_symbol = 24
    y = demo_data(num_symbols, samples_per_symbol)

    p1 = eyediagram(y, 2*samples_per_symbol, offset=16, cmap=coolwarm,
                    filename='bok_demo.html')

    # If you don't want the dependency on matplotlib, replace `cmap=coolwarm`
    # with, say, `color=(160, 145, 50)`.

    show(p1)

Example - pyqtgraph
-------------------

The script `pyqtgraph_demo.py` in the `demo` directory shows how an eye diagram can be
displayed using the graphics library `pyqtgraph`.  It generates this plot:
